Text splitters are tools specifically designed to accomplish this, ensuring that lengthy texts are divided into coherent segments. This division is crucial for maintaining the integrity and readability of the information, making it easier to handle and process. Effective text splitting helps prevent overwhelming systems with large, unwieldy blocks of text and ensures that each segment remains meaningful and contextually relevant.\n","\n","The significance of text splitters becomes even more apparent in the context of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). RAG involves fetching relevant pieces of information from a large dataset and using them to generate accurate and context-aware responses. Without properly split text, the retrieval process can become inefficient, potentially missing critical pieces of information or returning irrelevant data. By using text splitters to create well-defined chunks, the retrieval process can be streamlined, ensuring that the most relevant information is easily accessible. This not only enhances the efficiency of data retrieval but also improves the quality and relevance of the generated responses, making text splitters an important tool in the RAG workflow.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"abe93483-f924-4239-9e51-0f678d9dfa73","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["<figure>\n","    <img src=\"https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/3Y4eB0v7LXU5cSVbeN1b8A/text-splitter.png\" width=\"50%\" alt=\"langchain\">\n","    <figcaption><a>source: DALL-E</a></figcaption>\n","</figure>\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"f8327090-046e-466d-8a15-e05aa9cf2cfc","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["This lab will guide you about how to use some commonly used text splitters from LangChain to split your source document.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"c9a4a7cd-158f-4acc-b378-1740eddafd1c","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["## __Table of Contents__\n","\n","<ol>\n","    <li><a href=\"#Objectives\">Objectives</a></li>\n","    <li>\n","        <a href=\"#Setup\">Setup</a>\n","        <ol>\n","            <li><a href=\"#Installing-required-libraries\">Installing required libraries</a></li>\n","        </ol>\n","    </li>\n","    <li>\n","        <a href=\"#Text-splitters\">Text splitters</a>\n","        <ol>\n","            <li><a href=\"#Key-parameters\">Key parameters</a></li>\n","            <li><a href=\"#Prepare-the-document\">Prepare the document</a></li>\n","            <li><a href=\"#Split-by-Character\">Split by Character</a></li>\n","            <li><a href=\"#Recursively-Split-by-Character\">Recursively Split by Character</a></li>\n","            <li><a href=\"#Split-Code\">Split Code</a></li>\n","            <li><a href=\"#Markdown-Header-Text-Splitter\">Markdown Header Text Splitter</a></li>\n","            <li><a href=\"#Split-by-HTML\">Split by HTML</a></li>\n","        </ol>\n","    </li>\n","</ol>\n","\n","<a href=\"#Exercises\">Exercises</a>\n","<ol>\n","    <li><a href=\"#Exercise-1---Changing-separator-for-CharacterTextSplitter\">Exercise 1.

In recent years, LLMs have made significant advances in a variety of natural language processing tasks, including language translation, text generation, and sentiment analysis.\n    \n    \\subsection{History of LLMs}\n    The earliest LLMs were developed in the 1980s and 1990s, but they were limited by the amount of data that could be processed and the computational power available at the time. In the past decade, however, advances in hardware and software have made it possible to train LLMs on massive datasets, leading to significant improvements in performance.\n    \n    \\subsection{Applications of LLMs}\n    LLMs have many applications in industry, including chatbots, content creation, and virtual assistants. They can also be used in academia for research in linguistics, psychology, and computational linguistics.\n    \n    \\end{document}\n\"\"\""]},{"cell_type":"code","id":"da1429cb-215b-4b3e-a385-90dfc42e83ae","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["# Your code here"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"d4b4c694-cf8d-44db-9e26-58bcfb83afa1","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["<details>\n","    <summary>Click here for Solution</summary>\n","\n","```python\n","latex_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter.from_language(\n","    language=Language.LATEX, chunk_size=60, chunk_overlap=0\n",")\n","latex_docs = latex_splitter.create_documents([latex_text])\n","latex_docs\n","```\n","\n","</details>\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"7130ffcf-0365-4f99-9783-49fa3e4f0360","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["## Authors\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"3491ba22-4c9c-4a13-84fb-bcb0e3332480","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["[Kang Wang](https://author.skills.network/instructors/kang_wang)\n","\n","Kang Wang is a Data Scientist in IBM.
